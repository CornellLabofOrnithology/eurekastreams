## Overview
The start page serves as a private homepage for the knowledge worker allowing them to organize and find the information that they need on a day to day basis. The user has access to a gallery where they can choose from a collection of apps that they place on their start page. A knowledge worker can also organize the apps on their start page by grouping them under tabs. Unlike traditional enterprise web portals, knowledge workers not only have complete control over the content but they may also apply a theme to change the look and feel.

1. Opens app in canvas view (maximize)
2. Minimizes the app
3. Refreshes app
4. Deletes app from the tab. Upon clicking the icon a pop up window is displayed asking the knowledge worker if they are sure they want to delete the app. After the app is deleted, feedback is displayed at the top of the page with an undo and close option: "App has been removed". Refer to the [Action Feedback UI design pattern][Action feedback] for additional details.

1. Dragging the title bar of an app displays a proxy image containing the name of the app. When the knowledge worker drags the app over an empty column a dashed box appears. When the proxy is released over the column the app appears in that column.

### Moving an App onto Another Tab
![](images/PS_F02_startPage_appDragBetweenTabs.png)

### Editing Tabs
![](images/PS_F02_startPage_ManageTabs_fig02.png)

1. Clicking the tab menu icon displays a drop down menu.
2. Link to change the tab's layout
3. Link to rename the tab, when this is selected the name of the tab appears in an editable input box. Clicking the "+" tab adds a new tab with the editable input box. Tabs only display the first 16 characters.
4. Link to remove the tab. When this is selected a popup window is displayed asking the knowledge worker if they are sure they want to remove the tab. If Yes is selected, feedback is displayed at the top of the page with an undo and close option: "[tab name] has been removed".  Refer to the [Action Feedback UI design pattern][Action feedback] for additional details.
5. The knowledge worker can reorder the tabs by dragging and dropping the tab into place.

### Changing a Tab's Layout
![](images/PS_F02_startPage_ChangeLayout.png)

1. Selecting "Change Layout" from the tab menu displays the change layout window.
2. Carousel paging
3. Hover state, clicking on the layout applies the layout to the tab and changes the currently selected layout image on the right.

### Adding an App
![](images/PS_F02_startPage_ConfigureTab.png)

1. The configure button should take the background color of the inactive tab and the text color of the inactive tab. There should also be a 1px line around the configure button that takes the color of the inactive tab text. Clicking the configure button displays the Configure page.  Apps are added to the first column in the start page by default.
2. Clicking the Add an App link displays the Configure page.  Apps are added to the column on the start page where the Add an App link was selected.

![](images/PS_F02_startPage_AddApp.png)

1. Adds the app to the first tab of the knowledge worker's start page.  Feedback displays at top of page with a close option: 'App has been added'. Refer to the [Action Feedback UI design pattern][Action feedback] for additional details.
2. The add button becomes inactive after the app has been added.


### Applying a Theme
