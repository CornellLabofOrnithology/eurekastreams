	<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE:  Due to the current configuration in web.xml and the behavior of URLRewrite, the rewrites will
		be evaluated AGAIN if a URL is rewritten.  Therefore make sure:
			1. No rule blocks or alters a pattern that is the output of a rewrite.
			2. Beware of infinite loops.
		Why it runs again:  This filter is configured on the REQUEST and FORWARD filter chains.  URLRewrite performs a 
		forward if it rewrites a URL.  Thus when a request coming down the filter chain gets its URL rewritten, it gets
		forwarded and starts down a new FORWARD filter chain where it encounters this same filter (again).
